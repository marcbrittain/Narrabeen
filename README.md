# Narrabeen-Dataset

In mid 2016, the survery program at the Narrabeen-Collaroy beach in Australia published a a multi-decade dataset of monthly beach profile surveys and inshore wave forcing information.
My goal is to examine this data and to use different machine learning techniques to forecast future shoreline positions.
